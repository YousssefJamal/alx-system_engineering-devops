# Web Stack Outage Postmortem: The Case of the Vanishing API 

**Issue Summary**

* **Duration:** 2 hours, 11:00 AM - 1:00 PM EET (Eastern European Time) 
* **Impact:** Our primary API endpoint was completely unresponsive, resulting in a total outage of our core web application. 100% of users were affected, unable to access any features or perform any actions.
* **Root Cause:** A misconfigured load balancer, coupled with a sudden traffic spike, overwhelmed our API server, leading to a cascading failure.

## Timeline

* **11:00 AM:**  Monitoring alerts triggered, indicating a sharp rise in API response times and error rates.
* **11:15 AM:** Engineering team mobilized, initial investigations focused on potential database bottlenecks or code issues.
* **11:30 AM:** Misleading path: Attempted database optimizations and code rollbacks, but no improvement observed. 
* **12:00 PM:** Incident escalated to senior engineers and DevOps team. Load balancer identified as a potential culprit.
* **12:30 PM:** Root cause isolated: Load balancer configuration error causing uneven traffic distribution and overloading the API server.
* **1:00 PM:** Fix implemented: Load balancer reconfigured, API server gradually recovered, and full service restored.

## Root Cause and Resolution

The outage stemmed from a confluence of factors:

1. **Load Balancer Misconfiguration:** A recent update to our load balancer inadvertently introduced a configuration error, resulting in a disproportionate amount of traffic being routed to a single API server.

2. **Traffic Spike:** An unexpected surge in user activity further exacerbated the issue, pushing the already overburdened server beyond its capacity. 

The resolution involved:

1. **Identifying the Misconfiguration:** Careful analysis of load balancer logs and server metrics revealed the skewed traffic distribution.

2. **Reconfiguration:** The load balancer settings were corrected, ensuring a more balanced distribution of requests across available servers.

3. **Server Recovery:** The API server, relieved of the excessive load, gradually recovered and resumed normal operation.

## Corrective and Preventative Measures

**Areas for Improvement:**

* **Load Balancer Robustness:** Enhance load balancer configuration validation and testing procedures to prevent similar misconfigurations in the future.
* **Traffic Management:** Implement better mechanisms for handling sudden traffic spikes, such as rate limiting or auto-scaling.
* **Monitoring and Alerting:** Refine monitoring thresholds and alert escalation processes to ensure faster incident detection and response.

**Specific Tasks:**

* **Patch Load Balancer:** Apply latest updates and security patches to the load balancer software.
* **Add Monitoring:** Implement more granular monitoring for load balancer metrics, including traffic distribution and server health.
* **Review Configurations:** Conduct regular reviews of load balancer and other critical infrastructure configurations.
* **Automate Testing:** Develop automated testing scripts to validate load balancer configurations after changes.
* **Implement Rate Limiting:** Configure rate limiting at the API gateway level to protect against traffic spikes.
* **Explore Auto-Scaling:** Investigate the feasibility of auto-scaling for the API server layer to handle sudden load increases.
* **Fine-Tune Alerting:** Adjust monitoring thresholds and alert notifications to reduce false positives and improve incident response times.

## Conclusion: Learning from the Chaos 

This outage served as a stark reminder of the interconnectedness and fragility of complex web systems. While the incident caused disruption, it also provided valuable lessons for improving our infrastructure resilience and incident response capabilities. We remain committed to providing a reliable and robust service to our users, and we will continue to learn and adapt from such experiences.
